  question(
    slide(force_scale: 0.75em)[


      Consider a spring with a mass attached to the end.

      #springmass


      Let $x(t) =$ displacement to the right of the spring from equilibrium at time $t$.

      Recall from Physics the following laws:

      - (HL) Hooke's Law: For an elastic spring, force is proportional to negative the displacement from equilibrium.
      - (NL) Newton's Second Law: Force is proportional to acceleration (the proportionality constant is called mass).
      - (ML) Laws of Motion: Velocity is the time derivative of displacement and acceleration is the time derivative of velocity.

      // #v(1in)

      + Model $x(t)$ with a differential equation.

        For the remaining parts, assume the elasticity of the spring is $k = 1$ and the mass is $1$.

      + Suppose the spring is stretched $0.5$m from equilibrium and then let go (at time $t = 0$).
        + At $t = 0$, what are $x$, $x'$, and $x''$?
        + Modify Euler's method to approximate a solution to the initial value problem.

      + Introduce the auxiliary equation $y = x'$. Can the second-order spring equation be rewritten as a first-order system involving $x'$ and $y'$? If so, do it.

      + Simulate the _system_ you found in the previous part using Euler's method.

      Consider the second-order differential equation
      $ x'' = - (1 + x) dot x' + x^2 - x $

      + Rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of first-order differential equations. (Hint: you may need to introduce an auxiliary equation.)

      + The following Desmos link plots a phase portrait and draws an Euler approximation on the phase portrait:

        #link("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fvqxqp6eds")

        Use the link to make a phase portrait for your system and answer the following questions:
        + Are there initial conditions with $x(0) < 0$ so that a solution $x(t)$ is always increasing?
        + Are there initial conditions with $x(0) < 0$ so that a solution $x(t)$ first decreases and then increases?

      + Show that $x(t) = 0$ is an equilibrium solution for this equation.

      + Use linearization and eigenvalues to classify the equilibrium $(x, x') = (0, 0)$ in phase space.

      + Let $x(t)$ be a solution to the original equation and suppose $x(0) = delta_1 approx 0$.
        + If $x'(0) = delta_2 approx 0$, speculate on the long term behaviour of $x(t)$.
        + If we put no conditions on $x'(0)$ will your answer be the same? Explain.
