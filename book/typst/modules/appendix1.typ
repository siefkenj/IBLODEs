In this appendix you will learn:
- The basics of spreadsheet usage
- How to set up formulas in spreadsheets

_Spreadsheets_ serve as a powerful data analysis and management tool. Commonly associated with
Microsoft Excel, spreadsheets provide an interactive table that, for us, is ideal for implementing
some of the basic algorithms for simulating solutions to differential equations.

== Spreadsheet Basics

The interface to a spreadsheet is a table of editable _cells_. Every column of the spreadsheet is
indexed by a capital letter (_A_, _B_, _C_, ..., _Z_, _AA_, _AB_, ..., with the column names turning
to double letters after _Z_), and the rows indexed by numbers, starting at _1_.

#align(
  center,
  draw_spreadsheet(
    cells: (
      "B2": (
        value: serif([_Cell "B2"_]),
        alignment: center,
      ),
      "E2": (
        value: serif([_Cell "E2"_]),
        alignment: center,
      ),
      "A4": (
        value: serif([_Cell "A4"_]),
        alignment: center,
      ),
    ),
  ),
)

Text or numbers can be entered into any cell of a spreadsheet.

=== Formulas

If a cell's contents start with an _equals sign_ `=`, what follows will be interpreted as a formula.
Formulas can include math expressions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as well as references to other cells.

For example, when the following spreadsheet is evaluated, the contents of `B2` will be `9` and the
contents of `C2` will be `10`.
#align(
  center,
  stack(
    dir: ltr,
    spacing: 1em,
    draw_spreadsheet(
      cols: 3,
      cells: (
        "A1": (
          value: "4.5",
          alignment: right,
        ),
        "B2": (
          value: [`=A1*2`],
          alignment: left,
        ),
        "C2": (
          value: [`=B2+1`],
          alignment: left,
        ),
      ),
    ),
    align(horizon, sym.arrow),
    draw_spreadsheet(
      cols: 3,
      cells: (
        "A1": (
          value: "4.5",
          alignment: right,
        ),
        "B2": (
          value: "9",
          alignment: right,
        ),
        "C2": (
          value: "10",
          alignment: right,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ),
)


Formulas can be _interpolated_ when copy/pasted or extended to other cells. In the following
example, the formula `=A1+1` is being interpolated to "add one to the previous cell".
#align(
  center,
  stack(
    dir: ltr,
    spacing: 1em,
    draw_spreadsheet(
      cols: 1,
      cells: (
        "A1": (
          value: "4.5",
          alignment: right,
        ),
        "A2": (
          value: [`=A1+1`],
          alignment: left,
        ),
      ),
      select_cells: (pos: "A2", corner_cursor: (se: true)),
      additional_draw_function: cell_extents => {
        import "@preview/cetz:0.4.0"
        import cetz.draw: *

        let (right, bottom) = cell_extents("A2")
        let (right: right2, bottom: bottom2) = cell_extents("A5")
        let color = red.darken(20%)

        circle((right, bottom), radius: 5pt, stroke: (paint: color, dash: (2pt, 2pt)), name: "circ")
        line(
          "circ.start",
          (right2, bottom2),
          stroke: (paint: color, dash: (2pt, 2pt)),
          mark: (end: (symbol: "straight")),
          name: "line",
        )
        content(
          ("line.start", 20%, "line.end"),
          angle: "line.end",
          anchor: "north",
          padding: .2,
          text(fill: color)[Drag down],
        )
      },
    ),
    align(horizon, sym.arrow),
    draw_spreadsheet(
      cols: 1,
      cells: (
        "A1": (
          value: "4.5",
          alignment: right,
        ),
        "A2": (
          value: [`=A1+1`],
          alignment: left,
        ),
        "A3": (
          value: [`=A2+1`],
          alignment: left,
        ),
        "A4": (
          value: [`=A3+1`],
          alignment: left,
        ),
        "A5": (
          value: [`=A4+1`],
          alignment: left,
        ),
      ),
      additional_draw_function: cell_extents => {
        import "@preview/cetz:0.4.0"
        import cetz.draw: *

        let (top, left) = cell_extents("A2")
        let (bottom, right) = cell_extents("A5")
        let color = green.darken(30%)

        line(
          (left, top),
          (right, top),
          (right, bottom),
          (left, bottom),
          close: true,
          stroke: color + 1.5pt,
        )
      },
    ),
    align(horizon, sym.arrow),
    draw_spreadsheet(
      cols: 1,
      cells: (
        "A1": (
          value: "4.5",
          alignment: right,
        ),
        "A2": (
          value: "5.5",
        ),
        "A3": (
          value: "6.5",
        ),
        "A4": (
          value: "7.5",
        ),
        "A5": (
          value: "8.5",
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ),
)

=== Preventing Interpolation

What if you don't want interpolation? Or you only want it in particular places? For example, instead
of adding `1` to the previous cell, let us add the value of `A2` to the previous cell.

We can prevent interpolation of a row/column/both by adding a "`$`" before the row/column in a cell
index. For example,
- `=A$1` would interpolate the column but not the row,
- `=$A1` would interpolate the row but not the column, and
- `=$A$1` would not interpolate either.

#align(
  center,
  {
    stack(
      dir: ltr,
      spacing: 1em,
      draw_spreadsheet(
        cols: 2,
        cells: (
          "A1": (
            value: "Delta",
          ),
          "A2": (
            value: "0.05",
          ),
          "B1": "t",
          "B2": "0",
          "B3": (value: [`=B2+$A$2`], alignment: left),
        ),
        select_cells: (pos: "B3", corner_cursor: (se: true)),
        additional_draw_function: cell_extents => {
          import "@preview/cetz:0.4.0"
          import cetz.draw: *

          let (right, bottom) = cell_extents("B3")

=== Pitfalls of Formulas

Spreadsheets are an incredible technology, but with their behaviour established in the 1980s, they
have a few quirks relative to more modern tools. Here are a few things to watch out for when using
spreadsheets:
- Blank cells are interpreted as `0` in formulas, so you may reference a cell that doesn't exist and
  rather than an error, your spreadsheet will output a number.
- If a cell displays `###`, the column may be too narrow to display the number. Try widening the
  column.
- To get the constant $pi$, you need to call `PI()`, with the parenthesis.
- Numbers have limited precision, so, for example, `EXP(1000)` will show an error.
- The order of operations is strange when it comes to negatives. For example `-5^2` is interpreted
  as `(-5)^2` and not `-(5^2)`. Add extra parenthesis or explicitly write `-1*5^2` to make sure you
  get the expected outcome.

== Graphing

To plot in a spreadsheet, select your data columns for your your x and y values. (This might be time
vs. ... for a plot in component space or $"var"_1$ vs. $"var"_2$ for a plot in phase space.) Then,
in the menu, select `Insert` > `Chart` > *`Scatter with Straight Lines`*.

#{
  show: align.with(center)
  image("../images/spreadsheet-plotting-1.svg", height: 3.5in)
}

It is important that you pick a plot from the "Scatter" category if you want to plot one column vs.
another (For example, if you select two columns and plot with a "Line" plot you will end up with two
graphs, not a single graph of one column vs. the other.). It is also important that you select the
"Straight Lines" variant of the scatter plot. If you choose the "Smooth Lines" variant, the graph
will be misleading when it comes to interpreting errors in your approximations.

To make multiple graphs vs. *the same* $x$ variable, you can select the column of $x$s and then any
number of columns of $y$s.

#{
  show: align.with(center)
  image("../images/spreadsheet-plotting-2.png", height: 2.5in)
}

However, if you'd like to plot multiple sets of $(x,y)$ pairs on the same graph (for example, if you
were comparing the results of Euler's method using different step sizes), you are best off using an
external plotting program like #link("https://www.desmos.com/calculator")[Desmos].

=== Plotting in Desmos

The free-to-use online graphing calculator, _Desmos_, is available at
https://www.desmos.com/calculator.

To plot your data in Desmos, copy your data columns *without headers* (i.e., only copy the numbers)
and paste them into a Desmos input graph.

#{
  show: align.with(center)
  image("../images/spreadsheet-plotting-3.png", height: 3in)
}

Then, `Shift + Click` or long `Click` on the icon next to the $y$ variable and set the plot style to
"lines".

#{
  show: align.with(center)
  image("../images/spreadsheet-plotting-4.svg", height: 2.5in)
}

If you want multiple graphs in the same plot, repeat the copy-and-paste process in a new cell.
