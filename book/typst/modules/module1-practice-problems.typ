      Winnie the Pooh, who is notably a bear, hibernates every winter. He wakes up every spring in
      April, and goes back to sleep every winter in October. This year he goes to sleep on October
      1st and wakes up on April 1st. Worried about Winnie's health, his friend Tigger decides to
      model Winnie's weight over his hibernation. Tigger makes the following assumptions about
      Winnie the Pooh's weight:
      - (T1) Winnie is 100 kg when he wakes up on April 1st. (Winnie told him this.)

          model and so writing the differential
          equation is a bit superfluous. However, in
          the future we will not be able to write an
          explicit or recursive model so easily.
        5. I really like the first example. It kinda desribes the thought process one should have when guessing and checking. It might be good to follow up this example with a sanity check question of like "Is this solution the same as the one we had before?" or something like that. I guess right now you kinda do it for them, which is fine too.
        6. Small thing but I think "Solving differential equations" should be called something else like "solutions to differential equations". That is just a bit easier to look up when a student is studying. It also might be a good idea in the section to state right before defining what a general solutions is to state that "There are problems asked more than any other when studying and solving differentatial equations: What is the general solution to this differential equation? and what is the particular solution to this differential equation given this some inital condition? There are respectily two kinds of answers to these questions: a general solution to a differentatial equation that doesn't specify an initial condition, and a specific function that is the solustion to an initial value problem". I am basically saying that there is parhaps room for a into to the ideas of solutions after the first two examples.
        7. I think I am understanding the structure of the book a little more now. I think it might make sense to have a couple of exercises interspersed in the books text as well as at the end of each section. This doesn't currently seem to be the case.

      Bonus questions:
      +
        + How would you write down the explicit function you found in question 7 (a) as a recursive
          relationship?
        + How would you write down the recursive relationship you found in question 7 (b) as an
          explicit function?
      + In question 5, do you have any critisisms of how student presented their work? Is their any
        way they could be better?
