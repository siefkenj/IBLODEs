      Is it possible to solve $y' = x y$ for $y(0) = 0$?  Is the solution unique?

    solution: [
      Yes a solution exists. The equation is $y' = f(x,y)$ where $f(x,y) = x y$.
      The function $f(x,y)$ is continuous and $(diff f)/(diff y) = x$, which is also continuous near $(0,0)$. So a solution exists and is unique.  (In fact, $y=0$ is the solution.)

        0 " if " y > 0,
        1 " if " y <= 0

      Does $y' = f(y)$, $y(0) = 0$ have a continuously differentiable solution?  Does Picard apply?  Why, or why not?
    ],
    solution: [
      Picard does not apply as $f$ is not continuous at $y=0$.
      The equation does not have a continuously differentiable solution.
      Suppose it did. Notice that
      $y'(0) = 1$.  By the first derivative test, $y(x) > 0$ for small positive $x$.
      But then for those $x$, we have $y'(x) = f(y(x)) = 0$.
      It is not possible for $y'$ to be continous, $y'(0)=1$ and
      $y'(x) = 0$ for arbitrarily small positive $x$.

    solution: [
      The solution is $y(x) = integral_(x_0)^x f(s) d s + y_0$, and this does indeed exist for every $x$.
