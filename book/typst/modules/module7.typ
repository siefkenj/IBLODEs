In this module you will learn
- What makes a differential equation _affine_.
- How to relate affine equations and matrix equations.
- How to solve differential equations of the form $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r) + arrow(b)$.

We have a firm grasp on how to solve matrix differential equations of the form
$arrow(r)'=M arrow(r)$. What about equations of the form $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r) + arrow(b)$?
Unfortunately, that extra "$+ space.thin arrow(b)$" changes a lot. For example, the solution set is
no longer a subspace!

#example(
  prompt: [Show that solutions to $y'=2y+1$ do _not_ form a subspace.],
  [
    Since $y'=2y+1$ is separable, we can explicitly solve to find solutions:
    $
      y(t) = A e^(2 t) - 1 / 2 wide "where" A "is a parameter".
    $
    Picking the solution $y_1(t)=-1 / 2$ (where $A=0$) and $y_2(t)=e^(2 t)-1 / 2$ (where $A=1$), let
    $
      y_3(t) = y_1(t) + y_2(t) = -1 / 2 + e^(2 t) - 1 / 2 = e^(2 t) - 1.
    $
    Differentiating, $y_3 '(t) = 2e^(2t) = 2y_3(t) + 2$, and so $y_3$ is _not_ a solution.
    Therefore, the solutions of $y'=2y+1$ _cannot_ form a subspace.
  ],
)

The issue is that $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r) + arrow(b)$ is no loner a matrix equation, it is an _affine
  equation_. Affine equations are matrix equations plus a vector of constants. We will soon see how
to compensate for the extra "$+ space.thin arrow(b)$".

== Centering about the Equilibrium

Let $M = mat(0, 1; 1, 0)$ and consider the equations #math.equation(
  block: true,
  numbering: "(1)",
  $arrow(u)'=M arrow(u)$,
)<eq:non-affine>
and #math.equation(
  block: true,
  numbering: "(1)",
  $arrow(v)'=M arrow(v) + mat(-1; -2).$,
)<eq:affine>
We can make phase portraits for both of these equations.


#{
  let F1(x, y) = (y, x)
  let F2(x, y) = (y - 1, x - 2)
  let xlim = (-7, 7)
  let ylim = (-7, 7)
  align(center, {
    vector_field(
      F1,
      title: $arrow(u)'=M arrow(u)$,
      xlim: xlim,
      ylim: ylim,
      spacing: (.75, .75),
      scale_segments: 20.0,
      width: 5cm,
      height: 5cm,
      yaxis: (position: 0, tip: tiptoe.stealth, ticks: none, subticks: none),
      xaxis: (position: 0, tip: tiptoe.stealth, ticks: none, subticks: none),
    )
    h(2em)
    vector_field(
      F2,
      title: $arrow(v)'=M arrow(v) + mat(-1; -2)$,
      xlim: xlim,
      ylim: ylim,
      spacing: (.75, .75),
      scale_segments: 20.0,
      width: 5cm,
      height: 5cm,
      yaxis: (position: 0, tip: tiptoe.stealth, ticks: none, subticks: none),
      xaxis: (position: 0, tip: tiptoe.stealth, ticks: none, subticks: none),
    )
  })
}

The phase portraits look very similar: they are shifts of each other. To figure out the exact shift,
let's analyze the equilibrium points of both equations.

$
  arrow(u)'=M arrow(u) = mat(0; 0) quad <==>quad arrow(u) = mat(0; 0)
$
and
$
  arrow(v)'=M arrow(v) + mat(-1; -2) = mat(0; 0) quad <==>quad arrow(v) = mat(2; 1)
$

and so the phase portraits are shifted by the vector $mat(2; 1)$.

We can use this information to relate the solutions to $arrow(u)'=M arrow(u)$ and
$arrow(v)'=M arrow(v) + mat(-1; -2)$ to each other. Let $arrow(v)$ be a solution to @eq:affine and
define the function
$
  arrow(s)(t) = arrow(v)(t) - mat(2; 1).
$
We can now compute
$
  arrow(s)'(t) = ( arrow(v)(t) - mat(2; 1))' = arrow(v)'(t) - mat(2; 1)' = arrow(v)'(t),
$
because the derivative of a constant vector is $arrow(0)$. Alternatively, multiplying by $M$ we get
$
  M arrow(s)(t) & =M (arrow(v)(t) - mat(2; 1)) \
                & = M arrow(v)(t) - M mat(2; 1) \
                & = M arrow(v)(t) - mat(1; 2)
                  = M arrow(v)(t) + mat(-1; -2) =
                  arrow(v)'(t).
$
In other words, $arrow(s)'=M arrow(s)$, and so $arrow(s)$ is a solution to @eq:non-affine. What we
have done is called a _change of variables_ and the result is that we can relate solutions to the
affine equation $arrow(v)'=M arrow(v) + mat(-1; -2)$ with solutions to the matrix equation
$arrow(u)'=M arrow(u)$.

#example(
  prompt: [Let $M=mat(1, 2; 3, 4)$ and suppose $arrow(v)$ is a solution to
    $arrow(v)'=M arrow(v) + mat(2; 0)$. Find a solution to $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r)$ in terms of
    $arrow(v)$.],
  [
    There are several methods to proceed: (i) we could start by finding the equilibrium points for
    each equation and then applying the difference between equilibrium points as a translation.
    Alternatively, (ii) we could start out by assuming that the solutions are related by _some_
    translation, and then figuring out what that translation is after the fact. Let's take approach
    (ii).

    We know that $arrow(v)$ is a solution to $arrow(v)'=M arrow(v) + mat(2; 0)$. Define
    $
      arrow(s)(t) = arrow(v)(t) + arrow(p)
    $
    for a vector $arrow(p)$ that we will determine later.


    We want $arrow(s)$ to be a solution to $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r)$. Computing
    $
      arrow(s)'(t) = (arrow(v)(t) + arrow(p))' = arrow(v)'(t) + arrow(p)' = arrow(v)'(t) = M arrow(v)(t) + mat(2; 0)
    $
    and
    $
      M arrow(s)(t) = M (arrow(v)(t) + arrow(p)) = M arrow(v)(t) + M arrow(p).
    $
    Setting these equal (because we want $arrow(s)' = M arrow(s)$) we see that
    $
      M arrow(p) = mat(2; 0)
    $
    and so $arrow(p) = M^(-1)mat(2; 0) = mat(-4; 3)$. Therefore, our solution to
    $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r)$ in terms of $arrow(v)$ is
    $
      arrow(s)(t) = arrow(v)(t) + mat(-4; 3).
    $

)

The processes we just followed (shifting a solution to the affine equation by its equilibrium point
to find a solution to the corresponding matrix equation) always works, and we will refer to it as
_centering about the equilibrium_.

#theorem(title: [Centering about the Equilibrium], [
  Let $M$ be a matrix and $arrow(b)$ a vector and consider the differential equations:
  #math.equation(
    block: true,
    numbering: "(1)",
    $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r)$,
  )<eq:abstract-non-affine>
  #math.equation(
    block: true,
    numbering: "(1)",
    $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r) + arrow(b)$,
  )<eq:abstract-affine>

  If $arrow(p)$ is the equilibrium point of the affine equation @eq:abstract-affine[] and $arrow(v)$
  is a solution to the affine equation @eq:abstract-affine[], then
  $
    arrow(s)(t) = arrow(v)(t) - arrow(p)
  $
  is a solution to the matrix equation @eq:abstract-non-affine[].

  Similarly, if $arrow(u)$ is a solution to the matrix equation @eq:abstract-non-affine[], then
  $
    arrow(q)(t) = arrow(u)(t) + arrow(p)
  $
  is a solution to the affine equation @eq:abstract-affine[].
])

_Proof:_ We leave the proof as an exercise for the reader.

== Solving Affine Equations

Centring (and uncentering) about the equilibrium can be used to solve affine equations. Let's use
our example from earlier:
$
  arrow(r)'= mat(0, 1; 1, 0) arrow(r) + mat(-1; -2)
$
By solving for $arrow(r)'(t)=arrow(0)$, we see that $arrow(r)(t)=mat(2; 1)$ is an equilibrium
solution. Next, we will apply our eigenvector techniques to solve the related equation
$arrow(r)'= mat(0, 1; 1, 0) arrow(r)$. This equation has solutions
$
  arrow(u)(t) = A e^(t) mat(1; 1) + B e^(-t) mat(1; -1) wide "where" A "and" B "are parameters".
$
_These are not solutions to the original affine equation!_ However, we can define
$
  arrow(s)(t) = arrow(u)(t) + mat(2; 1) = A e^(t) mat(1; 1) + B e^(-t) mat(1; -1) + mat(2; 1) wide "where" A "and" B "are parameters".
$
Now, we can check that $arrow(s)$ is a solution.
$
  arrow(s)'(t) = (A e^(t) mat(1; 1) + B e^(-t) mat(1; -1) + mat(2; 1))' & = A e^(t) mat(1; 1) - B e^(-t) mat(1; -1)
$
and
$
  mat(0, 1; 1, 0) arrow(s)(t) + mat(-1; -2) &= mat(0, 1; 1, 0) (A e^(t) mat(1; 1) + B e^(-t) mat(1; -1) + mat(2; 1)) + mat(-1; -2) \
  &= mat(0, 1; 1, 0) (A e^(t) mat(1; 1) + B e^(-t) mat(1; -1)) + mat(0, 1; 1, 0) mat(2; 1) + mat(-1; -2) \
  &= A e^(t) mat(1; 1) - B e^(-t) mat(1; -1) + mat(1; 2) + mat(-1; -2) \
  &= A e^(t) mat(1; 1) - B e^(-t) mat(1; -1),
$
and so $arrow(s)$ is a solution for every choice of $A$ and $B$.

=== Figuring out what to Shift by

Do not try to _memorize_ how to shift one solution to get another. Instead, spend some time
visualizing the relationship between solutions to an affine equation and its corresponding matrix
equation.

Remember: a matrix equation always has $arrow(r)(t)=arrow(0)$ as an equilibrium solution. So, if you
think of the phase space picture from before and translate the equilibrium solution, all other
solutions will be translated in the same way.

In the phase portraits below, the equilibrium solution for each system is marked with a black dot.
See how one phase portrait is a translate of the other?

  let ylim = (-7, 7)

      lq.plot((2,), (1,), mark-size: 10pt, mark-color: black, stroke: black),
    )
  })
}


A word of caution: when there is an equation in front of you, *actually compute the equilibrium
  solution(s)* since they may not be easy to directly read off from the equation. For example, with
an equation like $arrow(r)' = M arrow(r) + arrow(p)$, it is tempting to claim that $arrow(p)$ is an
equilibrium solution. In all likelihood, *it is not*! (It is actually $-M^(-1) arrow(p)$.)

== The Superposition Principle

Everything we've done so far can be restated in terms of the _superposition principle_, which itself
is a restatement of the following result from Linear Algebra.
#theorem(title: "Superposition Principle in Linear Algebra")[
  Let $arrow(p)$ be a solution to the matrix equation $A arrow(x)=arrow(b)$. Then, every solution to
  $A arrow(x)=arrow(b)$ can be written as
  $
    arrow(x) = arrow(p) + arrow(v)
  $
  where $arrow(v)$ is a solution to $A arrow(x) = arrow(0)$.
]

In the context of differential equations, we have the following theorem.
#theorem(title: "Superposition Principle for Differential Equations")[
  Let $arrow(p)$ be a solution to the affine equation $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r) + arrow(b)$. Then, every
  solution to $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r) + arrow(b)$ can be written as
  $
    arrow(r) = arrow(p) + arrow(u)
  $
  where $arrow(u)$ is a solution to the matrix equation $arrow(r)'=M arrow(r)$.
]
To see how these two theorems relate, we can do some rearranging. The affine equation
$
  arrow(r)'=M arrow(r) + arrow(b)
$
can be rewritten as
$
  arrow(r)' - M arrow(r) = arrow(b).
$
If $arrow(b)= arrow(0)$, we call the equation _homogeneous_; otherwise, it is _inhomogeneous_. So,
the superposition principle for differential equations states, that "every solution to an
inhomogeneous equation can be written as a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation plus a
solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation". This is exactly analogous to the superposition
principle from Linear Algebra: "every solution to a matrix equation is a particular solution plus a
solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation".
