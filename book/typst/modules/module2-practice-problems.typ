      From experience and protocol,

      when she flys her fighter, her 
      change in height will be proportional

      given orders to take action otherwise. 
      Historically, the constant of 
      proprotiontionality between the wind 
      speed and her 
      rate of assent has been $1.2$
      in similar conditions. She will be 
      begining her journey $0.5 "km"$ above sea 
      level.

        that the pilot is understanding, 
        write down a differential equation
        that descibe 
        the rate of her assent as a function
        of the height that she is at currently.

        will go.

        Again make a prediction 
        of how high the pilot will go.

        correctly, your predictions should
        differ greatly. This difference is 
        too great to be described solely by

      In this question the idea of using
      Euler's method on a multidimensional
      system of differential equations
      is introduced. 
      Consider the system of differential
      equations
      $
        x' = y \ y' = x
      $
      where $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$ are both 
      functions of $t$. 
      + Assume $(t_0,x_0,y_0) = (0,0,1)$ 
        is the initial condition of this 
        differential equation. 
        Use this initial condition, similar
        to if you had only one differential
        equation to compute $x'$ and $y'$ 
        and the this initial condition.
      + You now since you have 
        $x_0 = f(0)$, $y_0 = g(0)$, 
        $x'|_(t=0) = f'(0)$, and 
        $y'|_(t=0) = g'(0)$  you should be 
        able to use linear appoximation calculate
        $
          x_1 = x_0 + Delta dot x'|_(t=0) \
          y_1 = y_0 + Delta dot y'|_(t=0)
        $
        with $Delta = 0.1$.
      + Again, you now should have a point 
        $(t_1,x_1,y_1)$ where 
        $t_1 = t_0+Delta$. Again use 
        your pair of differential equations
        to calculate $x'$ and $y'$ at $t_1$.
      + Use the same process as part (b) 
        to calculate linear 
        appoximations 
        $x_2 approx f(t_2)$ and 
        $y_2 approx g(t_2)$, where 
        $t_2 = t_1 + Delta$.
      + Enter all your data into
        a table with $5$ columns. 
        Continue until you have 
        $x_4 approx f(t_4)$, $y_4 approx g(t_4)$, 
        $x'|_(t=t_4) = f'(t_4)$, and 
        $y'|_(t=t_4) = g'(t_4)$
      + Enter all this data into a program 
        similar to Excel such that all
        calculations are computed automatically.

        $(t_(365),x_(365),y_(365))$.

      True or false:

        $f(y,y',t) = 0$ is autonomous
        if an only if on any slope feild 
        of that differential equation
        each $y$ value has only one slope value 
        $y'$, independent of $t$.
        /*I am a little worried about the
        phrasing here to make it strictly true*/
      + Since particular solutions to a \
        differential 
        equation differ by a constant, they are 
        all

      + There is a differential equation Eulers 
        method is exactly accurate at all points
        no matter what the step size is.
      + Assume that you are given a differential 
        equation with initial condition 
        $(t, P(t)) = (a,b)$. 
        Since Euler's method has a 
        starting point of the 
        initial condition and 
        only goes forward in time, 
        it can only be used to 
        approximate solutions for $t > a$.

      + It is possible only to use Euler's 
        method to approximate a solution 
        to a differential equation 
        if you are given an initial condition. 
      + Other than the initial condition itself, which 
        we know is correct, the points given to us by 
        Euler's method always have the least error 
        closest to the initial condition.
        // I am torn on this one.

      Notes from Jake while reading the book:
      + Once Jason likened defining a new function to be "that which solves some differential equation" to defining "e" to be "that number that is the limit of $(1 + 1/n)^n$ as $n$ approaches infinity" or "$e^x$" as "that function that is it's own derivative". I think this is a good analogy, and furthermore I think that it might be cool to somehow incorporate this into the first few paragraph of this chapter.
      + In my opinion, the words "linear appoximation" must be said if introducing Euler's method. I believe students coming out of calculus have linear appoximation etched into their brains, and so it is a good idea to use this term.
      + In the first example of the use of Euler's method I think that it is also important to mention that we do not know the value of $P'(0.5)$, not just that we do not know $P(0.5)$.
      + In example 1 in the chapter, I think the visuals could be workshopped to be a bit better.
      + This might be too meny question in the problem set here.

        question 1 (c)? If so, is this 
        particular solution
        special in some way that you can describe
        with respect to the differential 
        equation?
        If not, why is it inconsistent?

        question 6:
        + The differential equation that you came 
          up with in question 6 (a) is most likely 
          seperable. Use this to find the solution 
          to your differential equation
        + Use that solution to find exactly the 
          half-life of the sample of Uranium. How 
          close is your approximation to the true 
          value?
        + Would it have been possible to find the  
          half-life without the solution to the 
          differential equation? In this case, 
          parhaps you could use only the 
          differential equation itself and not its 
          solution.
          //Not sure this is possible.

          Euler's method. This should 
          be done by hand this time, 
          so there must be a way 
          to incentivize this.

        $y$ as a function of $x$. What shape 
        do you get? Write a sentance or two
        descibing how and why changing 
        the value of $Delta$ changes this
        shape. What would the shape look like 
        if you could make delta infinitly small?
