      You are observing starfish that made their way to a previously uninhabited tide-pool. You’d like to predict
      the year-on-year population of these starfish.
      You start with a simple assumption
      $
        "#new children per year" ~ "size of current population"
      $

      + Come up with a mathematical model for the number of star fish in a given year. Your model should
        - Define any notation (variables and parameters) you use
        - Include at least one formula/equation
        - Explain how your formula/equation relates to the starting assumption

      #solution([
        Definitions:
        - $P(t)$ is the number of starfish at the start of year $t$.
        - $K$ is the number of children born at the end of the year per starfish per year.
        - $P(0) = P_0$ is the initial population of starfish.

        Assumptions:
        - Starfish have children once per year.
        - Baby starfish are ready to procreate immediately.
        - Starfish do not die or otherwise leave the tide-pool.

        Relationships:

          $MM_1$ is easy to simulate and it is easy to explain where it came from. However,
          in order to find the population at year $t$, you must first find the population at all previous years.

          $MM^*_1$ is easy to compute (provided you have a calculator). It can compute the population at any time without
