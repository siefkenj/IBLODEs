In this module you will learn
- What is a boundary value problem
- How to solve a boundary value problem
- How to approximate the solutions of a boundary value problem


=== What is a boundary value problem?

Until now, we always studied differential equations with some initial conditions: conditions given
all for the same value of the dependent variable. These are called _initial value problems_.

_Boundary value problems_ are composed by one or more differential equation and a set of conditions
given at different values of the dependent variable.


#example(
  prompt: [
    Consider the differential equation $u''(x) = -u(x)$ with the conditions below. Which of these
    are initial value problems and which are boundary value problems?],
  [
    + $u(0) = 0, u'(0) = -1$ is an initial value problem, because all the conditions are given for
      the same value of $x$, namely $x=0$.
    + $u'(100) = -2, u''(100) = 3$ is also an initial value problem, with the conditions given for
      the value $x=100$.
    + $u(1) = 0, u'(2) = 0$ is a boundary value problem, because the conditions are given for
      different values of $x$: one condition at $x=1$ and the other at $x=2$.

)


=== Solving a boundary value problem

Typically a boundary value problem is higher order, since for first order differential equations we
only need one condition.

So the first step is usually to transform it into a system of differential equations. Then we can
solve it using the methods outlined in previous modules.

Once we have a general solution, we find the arbitrary constants using the conditions. It is exactly
the same process as the one to solve an initial value problem.


=== Existence and Uniqueness of solution

The Theorem introduced in @mod:real doesn't apply to this type of conditions. In fact, there is no
general Theorem of Existence and Uniqueness of solutions for boundary value problems.



=== Simulating solutions using the shooting method


Euler's method requires a full set of initial conditions to start and simulate the solution of a
differential equation, so it doesn't apply to a boundary value problem.

Instead, we need to modify it into what is known as a _shooting method_.

The idea of the _shooting method_ is the following:
+ Start with the boundary condition for the smallest value of $x=x_0$.
+ Introduce parameters $arrow(xi)$ for the remaining componentsnecessary to complete an initial
  condition at $x=x_0$.
+ Start with some value $arrow(xi)_0$, e.g. $arrow(xi)_0=arrow(0)$ and use Euler's method to
  simulate the solution until it reaches the other coundary condition at $x_1$.
+ Adjust the value of the parameter $arrow(xi)$ and simulate again.
+ Repeat until you find a solution that satisfies the boundary condition at $x_1$ or comes very
  close to it.

        u'' = - 2 u' - 2u,

    We first write this differential equation as a system
    $ arrow(r)' = mat(0, 1; -2, -2) arrow(r). $

    Our boundary condition at $x=0$, gives us the first component of an initial condition. To be
    able to simulate the solution, we need to introduce a parameter for the second component of the
    vector $arrow(r)$, so we write:
    $ arrow(r)(0) = mat(1; xi) $

    Let us start with $x_i = 0$. We can use Euler's method to simulate the solution of the system
    with $h=0.01$ and obtain
    $ arrow(r)(1) approx mat(0.507; -0.623) $

    This means that the approximation of the solution at $x=1$ is $u(1) approx 0.507$.

    Observe that we really only care about the first component of the vector $arrow(r)(x)$, which is
    the solution $u(x)$ of the original differential equation.

    Here is a table of the successive applications of the Euler's Method with different initial
    conditions and how close the solution is to the boundary condition at $x=1$:

    #align(
      center,
      simple_table(
        headers: ($xi$, $u(1)$),
        content: (
          $0$,
          $0.507$,
          $1$,
          $0.818$,
          $2$,
          $1.130$,
          $1.5$,
          $0.974$,
          $1.75$,
          $1.052$,
          $1.625$,
          $1.013$,
          $1.5625$,
          $0.994$,
        ),
      ),
    )

    To adjust the value of $xi$, we started with an initial guess of $xi=0$ and increased it until
    we obtained two values of $u(1)$ that are on either side of the boundary condition $u(1)=1$. In
    this case, we found that $u(1) < 1$ for $xi=1$ and $u(1) > 1$ for $xi=2$. That means that the
    value of $xi$ we are looking for is between $1$ and $2$, so we successively bisected the
    interval $[1, 2]$ to find a better approximation of $xi$.

    There are lots of different methods to adjust the value of $xi$ to get closer to the boundary
    condition at $x=1$. Here we just used a simple bisection method, but you can use any method you
    like.


    We can see that the value of $u(1)$ is getting closer to the boundary condition $u(1)=1$ as we
    adjust the value of $xi$.

    Once we are happy with the approximation, we can sketch the solution we found. Below is the
    grpah for the simulation with $xi = 1.5625$.

    // where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants.

    // $ u(pi/2) = c_1 e^(-pi/2) + c_2 e^(-pi/2) = 1 $
    // We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$:
    // $ c_1 = 1 - c_2, quad c_2 = e^(pi/2) - 1 $
