#label_module(<mod:equilibrium>)

In this module you will learn
- What equilibrium solutions and equilibrium points are.
- How are equilibrium points related to the long term behavior of a differential equation/system of
  differential equations.

Models built from differential equations tell you how quantities _change_. Equally important,
though, are the conditions under which quantities _do not_ change. In science and engineering, when
a system is in a state that doesn't change, we say it is at _equilibrium_. In the context of
differential equations, solutions that don't change are called _equilibrium solutions_.

#show_def("equilibrium_solution")

Suppose you are modelling a leaf falling from a balcony onto the ground. Let $h(t)$ represent the
height of the leaf above the ground at time $t$. Assume that air resistance causes the leaf to fall
at a constant speed of $1$ $m slash s$. With this assumption, the leaf's motion can be modeled by
the differential equation
$
  h' = cases(
    -1 & " if " h > 0,
    0 & " if " h <= 0,
  ).
$
Looking at a slope field for this equation, we can see that most solutions look "L"-shaped, first
decreasing to zero and then remaining constant.

#{
  align(center, slope_field(
    (x, y) => if y > 0 { -1 } else { 0 },
    xlim: (-.3, 3.1),
    ylim: (-.7, 3.3),
    width: 5cm,
    height: 6cm,
    spacing: .3,
    scale_segments: .15,
    yaxis: (
      position: 0,
      tip: tiptoe.stealth,
      filter: ((v, d) => calc.round(v, digits: 2) in (1., 2., 3.)),
    ),
    xaxis: (position: 0, tip: tiptoe.stealth, tick-distance: 1.0),
    xlabel: $t$,
    ylabel: lq.label($h$, dx: -0cm),
    lq.plot((0, 1, 3), (1, 0, 0), mark: none, stroke: 1.5pt, z-index: 100),
    lq.plot(
      (0, 2, 3),
      (2, 0, 0),
      mark: none,
      stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, dash: (4pt, 1pt)),
      z-index: 100,
    ),
  ))
}

But, there is one solution that is qualitatively different: $h(t)=0$. Indeed, the function $h(t)=0$
satisfies $h'(t)=0$, and so is a solution to the differential equation. It is the _equilibrium
  solution_ to the differential equation corresponding to the leaf resting on the ground (not
actually falling at all).

#v(1em)

Let's consider a more complicated example.

Two ponds, Pond $A$ and Pond $B$, each with a volume of 1 million litres, are connected by canals.
Pond $A$ is fed by a stream contaminated with pesticides from a nearby farm. Pond $B$ is fed by
a mountain stream of clean water. The ponds exchange water through their canals at a rate of 0.1
million litres per day. Additionally, the ponds have spill-gates that allow any excess water to flow
out of each pond so they maintain a constant volume.

We will assume:
- The ponds are well-mixed.
- Contaminated water flows into Pond $A$ at a rate of $0.05$ million litres per day with $1$
  kilogram of pesticide per million litres.
- Clean water flows into Pond $B$ at a rate of $0.02$ million litres per day.

Let $A(t)$ be the amount of pesticide (in kg) in Pond $A$ at time $t$, and let $B(t)$ be the amount of
pesticide (in kg) in Pond $B$ at time $t$.


We can model $A$ and $B$ with the following system of differential equations.#footnote[
  To come up with this model, notice that $A'$, the change in the amount of pesticide in Pond $A$,
  is equal to the inflow of pesticide minus the outflow of pesticide. Pond $A$ has an inflow of
  $0.05 "kg" slash "day"$ from farm runoff and an inflow of $0.1 dot B(t) "kg" slash "day"$ from
  Pond $B$. It has an outflow of $0.1 dot A(t) "kg" slash "day"$ to Pond $B$ and an outflow of
  $0.05 dot A(t) "kg" slash "day"$ to the environment. Thus
  $A'=0.05+0.1 dot B -0.1 dot A - 0.05 dot A= -0.15 dot A +0.1 dot B +0.05$. A similar argument will
  produce an equation for $B'$.
]
$
  A' & = & -0.15 dot & A & quad & + &  quad 0.1 dot & B & quad + quad & 0.05 \
  B' & = &   0.1 dot & A & quad & - & quad 0.12 dot & B &             &
$

With our model defined, we can now make plots showing the amount of pesticide vs. time given
different initial conditions.

Using our physical intuition, we would expect that the amount of pesticide in each pond tends
towards a constant (i.e., an equilibrium), and that's exactly what we see in the plots. No matter
the initial conditions, the eventual amount of pesticide in Pond $A$ is slightly less than
$0.8 "kg"$ and the eventual amount of pesticide in Pond $B$ is slightly more than $0.6 "kg"$.

We can compute the equilibrium solution to this differential equation exactly. Since we know that an
equilibrium solution is constant, the derivative of an equilibrium solution is always zero. Solving
$
   0 quad=quad A' & = & -0.15 dot & A & quad & + &  quad 0.1 dot & B & quad + quad & 0.05 \
  0 quad =quad B' & = &   0.1 dot & A & quad & - & quad 0.12 dot & B &             &
$
we arrive at the unique solution $(A,B)=(0.75, 0.625)$. In other words,
$
  A(t) & = 0.75 \
  B(t) & = 0.625
$
is the only equilibrium solution to this system.

#example(
  prompt: [Differential equations may have more than one equilibrium solution. Find all equilibrium

      Q' & = 2 P - Q dot (P + 1)
    $
  ],
  [
    To find the equilibrium solutions, we set $P' = 0$ and $Q' = 0$ and solve the resulting system
    of equations.
    $
      0 & = P dot Q - 4 P + 3 \
      0 & = 2 P - Q dot (P + 1)

    implies either $(P,Q)=(1,1)$ or $(P,Q)=(-3 / 2, 6)$.

    Therefore, the equilibrium solutions are

        P(t) & = -inline(3 / 2) \
        Q(t) & = 6

    ))
  ],
)

== Equilibrium Points

We can also examine equilibrium solutions in phase space. Using our pond example, we can make a plot
in phase space.

#align(center, {
  let width = 4.8cm
  lq.diagram(
    title: [Component Space],
    //legend: (position: bottom + right),
    width: width,
    ylim: (0, 1.5),
    lq.plot(ts, As, mark: none, stroke: 1.5pt, label: "Pond A"),
    lq.plot(ts, Bs, mark: none, stroke: 1.5pt, label: "Pond B"),
    xaxis: (label: [$t$ (days)]),
    yaxis: (label: [Pesticide (kg)]),
  )
  h(3em)
  lq.diagram(
    //legend: (position: bottom + right),
    title: [Phase Space],
    width: width,
    ylim: (0, 1.5),
    xlim: (0, 1.5),
    lq.plot(As, Bs, mark: none, stroke: 1.5pt, color: red.darken(20%)),
    //lq.plot(As2, Bs2, mark: none, stroke: 1.5pt),
    //lq.plot(As3, Bs3, mark: none, stroke: 1.5pt),
    xaxis: (label: [A], tick-distance: 0.2),
    yaxis: (label: [B], tick-distance: 0.2),
  )
})

As we noticed, all solutions tend towards the equilibrium solutions $A(t)=0.75$ and $B(t)=0.625$. In
phase space, this manifests as all solutions tending towards the point $(A,B)=(0.75, 0.625)$.
Further, if we graph the equilibrium solution $A(t)=0.75$ and $B(t)=0.625$ in phase space, instead
of a curve, we get a single point $(A,B)=(0.75, 0.625)$. We call this point an _equilibrium point_.

== Types of Equilibrium Solutions

In the mixing ponds example, all solutions tended towards the equilibrium solution (the equilibrium
solution is _attracting_). This isn't always the case.

Consider the following population model based on the assumptions of exponential growth and a
carrying capacity:#footnote[
  $100$ represents the carrying capacity of the environment. If the population exceeds the carrying
  capacity, individuals start dying.
]
$
  P'(t) = P(t) dot (100 - P(t))
$
Here, $P(t)$ represents the population of some organism at time $t$.

There are two equilibrium solutions: $P(t)=0$ and $P(t)=100$ (shown in solid colors). All other
solutions are non-constant (dashed lines).

#{
  let xs = lq.linspace(0, .1, num: 40)
  let P0(p_0) = 100 / p_0 - 1
  align(center, lq.diagram(
    title: [Population vs. Time],
    xaxis: (label: [$t$], ticks: none),
    yaxis: (label: [P], tick-distance: 50),
    ..(0.3, 0.9, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 110, 120, 130, 140).map(p_0 => {
      lq.plot(
        xs,
        xs.map(x => 100 * calc.exp(100 * x) / (P0(p_0) + calc.exp(100 * x))),
        mark: none,
        stroke: (
          thickness: .5pt,
          paint: black,
          dash: (2pt, 1pt),
        ),
      )
    }),
    lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => 100), mark: none, stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, paint: green.darken(30%))),
    lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => 0), mark: none, stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, paint: blue.darken(30%))),
  ))
}

We call the equilibrium solution $P(t)=0$ _unstable_ and _repelling_. That is, while it is true that
a population of exactly zero will stay that way, if there is even one individual (in this model at
least), the population will grow substantially. On the other hand, we call the equilibrium solution
$P(t)=100$ _stable_ and _attracting_ -- if the population is exactly $100$, it will stay that way, but
if the population is slightly less than or slightly more than $100$, it will tend towards $100$.

In general, equilibrium solutions can be classified as attracting, repelling, stable, and/or
unstable depending on the behaviour of solutions near that equilibrium (i.e., solutions with initial
conditions near the equilibrium point).

#show_def("equilibrium_classification_informal")

The above definition uses the term _local_ to refer to solutions that passes through points "close
to" that of the equilibrium solution. This can be made precise using $epsilon$-$delta$ definitions.

#show_def("equilibrium_classification_formal")

Whether using the formal or informal definition, the important thing is to have an intuition about
what different types of equilibrium solutions look like, both in _component space_ and _phase
  space_.

=== Stable and Attracting

We've already seen that for $P'=P dot (100 - P)$, the equilibrium solution $P(t)=100$ is stable and
attracting.

  let xs = lq.linspace(0, .1, num: 40)

          thickness: .5pt,
          paint: black,
          dash: (2pt, 1pt),
        ),
      )
    }),

- It is _stable_ because if a solution $P^*$ (dashed curves above) starts close to $P(t)=100$, then
  it will stay close to $P(t)=100$.
- The equilibrium solution $P(t)=100$ is _attracting_ because if a solution $P^*$ (dashed curves
  above) starts close to $P(t)=100$, its limit as $t arrow + infinity$ will actually be $100$.

=== Stable and not Attracting

Consider the differential equation $y'=0$. This equation has solutions of the form $y(t)=k$, where
$k$ is a constant. These are all equilibrium solutions!

Let's focus on the equilibrium solution $y(t)=0$.
#{
  let xs = lq.linspace(0, .1, num: 40)
  let P0(p_0) = 100 / p_0 - 1
  align(center, lq.diagram(
    xaxis: (label: [$t$], ticks: none),
    yaxis: (label: [$y$]),
    ylim: (-1, 1),
    xlim: (0, .1),
    ..(.2, -.2, .4, -.4).map(p_0 => {
      lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => p_0), mark: none, stroke: (
        thickness: .5pt,
        paint: black,
        dash: (2pt, 1pt),
      ))
    }),
    //   lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => 0), mark: none, stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, paint: green.darken(30%))),
    lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => 0), mark: none, stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, paint: blue.darken(30%))),
  ))
}

- This solution is _stable_ because if a solution $y^*(t)=k$ (a dashed curve above) starts close to
  $y(t)=0$, it will stay close to $y(t)=0$; in fact its distance from $y(t)$ will never change.
- However, $y(t)=0$ is _not attracting_, because if $y^*(t)=k$ is a solution that is close to
  $y(t)=0$, then $display(lim_(t arrow infinity) y^*(t) =k quad != quad 0)$.

=== Unstable and Repelling

Consider the differential equation $y'=-y dot (100 - y)$; the equilibrium solution $y(t)=100$ is
unstable and repelling.

#{
  let xs = lq.linspace(0, .1, num: 40)
  let xs2 = lq.linspace(0, .035, num: 20)
  let P0(p_0) = 100 / p_0 - 1
  let F(t, p_0) = {
    let exp = calc.exp(100 * t)
    100 / (P0(p_0) * exp + 1)
  }
  align(center, lq.diagram(
    xaxis: (label: [$t$], ticks: none),
    yaxis: (label: [$y$], tick-distance: 50),
    ylim: (0, 140),
    xlim: (0, .1),
    ..(98, 99).map(p_0 => {
      lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => F(x, p_0)), mark: none, stroke: (
        thickness: .5pt,
        paint: black,
        dash: (2pt, 1pt),
      ))
    }),
    ..(101, 102).map(p_0 => {
      lq.plot(xs2, xs2.map(x => F(x, p_0)), mark: none, stroke: (
        thickness: .5pt,
        paint: black,
        dash: (2pt, 1pt),
      ))
    }),
    lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => 100), mark: none, stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, paint: green.darken(30%))),
    //     lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => 0), mark: none, stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, paint: blue.darken(30%))),
  ))
}

- It is _unstable_ because if a solution $y^*$ (dashed curves above) starts close to $y(t)=100$, it
  does not stay close to $y(t)=100$.
- The equilibrium solution $y(t)=100$ is _repelling_ because there is a fixed distance $epsilon$
  such that any solution $y^*$ (dashed curves above) starting close to $y(t)=100$ will eventually
  end up at least $epsilon$ away from $y(t)=100$ for the rest of time (i.e., for all large $t$).

=== Unstable and not Repelling

Consider the differential equation $y'=1/7 t dot sin(t)dot y$. This equation has an equilibrium
solution $y(t)=0$ which is unstable but _not_ repelling. Notice that solutions that are near
$y(t)=0$ alternate between being very close to $y(t)=0$ and very far from $y(t)=0$ (dashed lines
below).

#{
  let xs = lq.linspace(0, 17, num: 200)
  let F(t, p_0) = {
    p_0 * calc.exp(1 / 7 * (calc.sin(t) - t * calc.cos(t)))
  }
  align(center, lq.diagram(
    xaxis: (label: [$t$], ticks: none),
    yaxis: (label: [$y$]),
    ylim: (-10, 10),
    xlim: (0, 17),
    ..(-1, -.5, .5, 1).map(p_0 => {
      lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => F(x, p_0)), mark: none, stroke: (
        thickness: .5pt,
        paint: black,
        dash: (2pt, 1pt),
      ))
    }),
    //   lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => 0), mark: none, stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, paint: green.darken(30%))),
    lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => 0), mark: none, stroke: (thickness: 1.5pt, paint: blue.darken(30%))),
  ))
}

- $y(t)=0$ is _unstable_ because solutions $y^*$ (dashed curves above) that start close to $y(t)=0$
  get far from $y(t)=0$ infinitely often.
- However, $y(t)=0$ is _not repelling_, because solutions $y^*$ close to but not equal to $0$ attain
  values arbitrarily close to zero infinitely often.

=== Other Classifications

There cannot be unstable and attracting equilibria, nor can there be stable and repelling
equilibria. But there can be other behaviours.

Consider the Van der Pol system:
$
  x' & = y \
  y' & = mu dot (1 - x^2) dot y - x
$
for $mu>0$.

Solutions to this system all end up with oscillatory behaviour and they all have the same period.
Here solutions are not attracted to an equilibrium, but they are attracted towards a solution which
is perfectly periodic (in this situation we say that the system has a _limit cycle_). The study of
what behaviour solutions can be "attracted to" leads to concepts like fractals and chaos (advanced
differential equations courses touch on these topics!).

#{
  let F(x, y) = (y, 0.08 * (1 - x * x) * y - x)
  let path1 = solve_2d_ivp(F, (11, -6.4), 400, Delta: .1, method: "rk4")
  let path2 = solve_2d_ivp(F, (-11, -6.4), 400, Delta: .1, method: "rk4")
  let path3 = solve_2d_ivp(F, (5, -10.4), 400, Delta: .1, method: "rk4")

  let diag = lq.diagram(
    title: [Van der Pol System\ with $mu=0.08$ in _Phase Space_],
    xaxis: (label: $x$, tick-distance: 3.9),
    yaxis: (label: $y$, tick-distance: 3.9),
    ylim: (-10, 10),
    xlim: (-10, 10),
    lq.plot(path1.map(((x, y)) => x), path1.map(((x, y)) => y), mark: none),
    lq.plot(path2.map(((x, y)) => x), path2.map(((x, y)) => y), mark: none, stroke: (
      dash: (4pt, 1pt),
    )),
    lq.plot(path3.map(((x, y)) => x), path3.map(((x, y)) => y), mark: none, stroke: (
      dash: (2pt, 2pt),
    )),
  )

In the above diagram you can see the oval-shaped limit cycle in the center to which solutions are
attracted.

#example(
  prompt: [Find an classify all equilibrium solutions to $y'=sin(y)$.],
  [
    Since equilibrium solutions are constant solutions, we can solve for when $y'=0$ to find all
    equilibrium solutions. Solving,
    $
      y'=0=sin(y)
    $
    has solutions $y(t)=k dot pi$ for $k in ZZ$. Thus, $y'=sin(y)$ has an infinite number of
    equilibrium solutions.

    We will start classifying them one by one and then see if there is a pattern.

    Case $y(t)=0$: Suppose that $y approx 0$ and that $y>0$. From the differential equation, we know
    $ y' = sin("slightly bigger than" 0) > 0 $
    so $y(t)$ will increase; i.e., solutions near $y(t)=0$ but above $y(t)=0$ will tend away from
    $y(t)=0$. This means that $y(t)=0$ is _unstable_. Now, suppose $y approx 0$ and $y < 0$. Then
    $ y' = sin("slightly smaller than" 0) < 0 $
    and so $y(t)$ will be decreasing and move away from $0$. This means that $y(t)=0$ is is an
    unstable and _repelling_ equilibrium solution.

    Case $y(t)=pi$: Suppose that $y approx pi$ and that $y>pi$. Then
    $ y' = sin("slightly bigger than" pi) < 0 $
    so $y(t)$ will decrease, heading towards $pi$. Alternatively, suppose $y approx pi$ and
    $y < pi$. Then
    $ y' = sin("slightly smaller than" pi) > 0 $
    so $y(t)$ will increase, heading towards $pi$. This means that solutions near $y(t)=pi$ are
    attracted to $y(t)=pi$. Thus, $y(t)=pi$ is a _stable_ and _attracting_ equilibrium solution.

    To conclude, notice that $y'=sin(y)$ is periodic with period $2pi$; therefore, the nature of the
    equilibrium solutions will repeat every $2pi$. This gives a final classification of:
