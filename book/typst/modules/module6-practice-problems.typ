    statement: [
      Let $S$ be the set of all solutions to 
      $ arrow(r)(t)= mat(1, 0; 0, 2) arrow(r)(t). $

      + Show that $"dim"(S) gt.eq 2$ by finding at least two linearly independent solutions.

      + Let $I$ be the set of all initial conditions. What is $I$?
      + Show that $"dim"(S) lt.eq 3$ by applying the theorem to the set of initial conditions.
      + Can two points in $I$ correspond to the same solution? Explain?
      + Find a subset $U subset.eq I$ so that every solution corresponds to a unique point in $U$.
      + Show that $"dim"(S) lt.eq 2$.
      + Suppose $M$ is an $n times n$ matrix. Consider the differential equation $arrow(r)'(t) = M arrow(r)(t)$. If you have found $n$ linearly independent solutions, can you determine the dimension of the set of all solutions? Explain.
