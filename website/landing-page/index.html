                                <em><strong>Differential Equations</strong></em>
                                is a free, open source textbook aimed at a
                                second year one-semester introductory
                                differential equations course. The book is
                                designed for a non-proofs-focused course with an
                                emphasis on modelling and simulation.

                                Originally designed for MAT244 at the University
                                of Toronto, student-facing (in-class) questions
                                are a main feature of
                                <em>Differential Equations</em>, and the
                                textbook doubles as a workbook with space for
                                students to write their solutions to questions.
                                It is designed to be used in classes taught
                                using

                                This book is your introductory guide to
                                differential equations. It is divided into
                                modules, and each module is further divided into
                                exposition, practice problems, and core
                                exercises.

                                    Start each module by reading through the
                                    exposition to get familiar with the main
                                    ideas and linear algebra terminology.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Work through the core exercises to develop
                                    an understanding and intuition behind the
                                    main ideas and their subtleties.

                                <li>
                                    Re-read the exposition and identify which
                                    concepts each core exercise connects with.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Work through the practice problems. These
                                    will serve as a check on whether you've
                                    understood the main ideas well enough to
                                    apply them.

                                not all) core exercises will be worked through
                                during lecture time, and there is space for you
                                to work provided after each of the core
                                exercises. The point of the core exercises is to
                                develop the main ideas of differential equations
                                by exploring examples.

                                This book was designed for a one-semester
                                introductory differential equations course in
                                the second year with a focus on modelling and
                                simulation (MAT244 at the University of
                                Toronto). It has not been designed for a
                                proofs-based course, nor is it designed for a
                                "learn 5 methods to solve specific ODEs"-course.

                                Unlike a traditional textbook that is grouped
                                into chapters and sections by subject, this book
                                is grouped into modules. Each module contains
                                exposition about a subject, practice problems
                                (for students to work on by themselves), and
                                core exercises (for students to work on with
                                your guidance). Modules group related concepts,
                                but the modules have been designed to facilitate
                                learning differential equations rather than to
                                serve as a reference.

                                        Students work individually or in

                                        core exercise. During this time the
                                        instructor moves around the room
                                        addressing questions that students may
                                        have and giving one-on-one coaching.

                                        When most students have successfully
                                        solved the problem, the instructor
                                        refocuses the class by providing an
                                        explanation or soliciting explanations
                                        from students. This is also time for the
                                        instructor to ensure that everyone has
                                        understood the main point of the
                                        exercise (since it is sometimes easy to
                                        miss the point!).

                                        If students are having trouble, the
                                        instructor can give hints and additional
                                        guidance to ensure students’ struggle is
                                        productive.

                                Using this format, students are thinking (and
                                happily so) most of the class. Further, after
                                struggling with a question, students are
                                especially primed to hear the insights of the

                                some core exercises focus on simple computation.
                                They also have a geometric lean. Vectors are
                                initially introduced with familiar coordinate
                                notation, but eventually, coordinates are
                                understood to be
                                <em class="emph">representations</em> of vectors
                                rather than “true” geometric vectors, and

                                oriented volumes rather than formulas involving

                                the mechanical skills of row reduction and
                                computing matrix inverses. Students must
                                practice these skills, but they require little
                                instructor intervention and so can be learned
                                outside of lecture (which is why core exercises
                                don’t focus on these skills).
