			In this tutorial, you will explore applications of Euler's method for approximating solutions to ODEs
			and the limits of Euler's method.

			These problems relate to the following course learning
			objective: \textit{use a computer to approximate the solutions to differential equations 
			and explain the advantages and draw-backs of computer-based approximations.}.

		\subsection*{Problems}
		
		Consider the differential equations
		\begin{equation}
			\label{tut1-ode}
			y'=\frac{4\sin(4x)}{1+y}
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\label{tut1-ode2}
			y'=4\sin(4x)
		\end{equation}

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Create a spread sheet that can approximate solutions to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode} with initial condition $y(0)=0$. Make sure you
			can adjust the step size (i.e., $\Delta$) in your spread sheet.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Justify both with a simulation and analytically (i.e. from the equation) whether or not $y(x)=0$
					is a solution to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode}.
					\item Apply Euler's method to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode} with a step size of $\Delta=0.7854$. Is this a reasonable approximation
					of a solution to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode}?
					\item Apply Euler's method to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode} with a step size of $\Delta=0.1$. Make a graph of your approximation
					and numerically identify where the local maxima and local minima of your solution are.
					\item Analytically determine where the local maxima and
					local minima should be.
					\label{got-maxima}
				\end{enumerate}

			\item We'd like to determine whether solutions to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode} are periodic or whether solutions both oscillate and \emph{drift}.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item In \ref{got-maxima}, you computed the location of all local maxima and minima of solutions to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode}.
					Use Euler's method with at least \emph{four} different step sizes (i.e. different $\Delta$s) and make a table of step-size vs. 
					$y$-value of the first 3 local minima.
					\item Do you think solutions to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode} are periodic? Do they have an upward drift? Provide a numerical justification.
					\item Verify that $A(x)=\sqrt{3-2\cos(4x)}-1$ is a solution to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode}.
					\item Use $A$ to analytically justify whether or not solutions to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode} are periodic.
				\end{enumerate}

			\item
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item For $\Delta=0.1$, make a graph of the error of the Euler approximation vs. $x$ for Equation \eqref{tut1-ode} (with initial condition $y(0)=0$).
					\item Find an analytic solution to Equation \eqref{tut1-ode2} and use it to produce a graph of the error in the
					Euler approximation vs. $x$ for Equation \eqref{tut1-ode2} (with initial condition $y(0)=0$).
					\item Respond to the following statement: \emph{When using Euler's method, errors always accumulate so the more steps you've run
					Euler's method, the bigger the error.}
				\end{enumerate}
